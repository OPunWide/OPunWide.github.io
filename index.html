<div class="the-content">

<p>This first "GitHub Page" is to test
    basic functionality, since most of the docs focus on using Jekyll and I
    don't want to do that. Can I load CSS, JS and use basic HTML? Yes.</p>
    
<p>It's clear that the key to making a GitHub Pages site is patience.</p>

<p>It may look like things are broken when they aren't. <em>Walk away.</em> 
    Five minutes later the file will have propagated through their system.</p>
